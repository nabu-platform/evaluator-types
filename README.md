# Evaluator Types

This package adds accessors for type-based objects in the evaluator. Additionally it provides extended operations with validation routines.

## History

This package actually predates the evaluator which was extracted from it at a later point to support type-less evaluation. For a while they lived side-by-side with this package standing still and the evaluator progressing rapidly feature-wise. This package has now been retrofitted to use the new and improved evaluator.

It has also been retrofitted for the more general validations.

**Note**: the validation code in this package is _very_ old and may need some cleanup.
